# methylome_analyses

This is the "Linux and Python codes" repository used for graphing and statistical analysis related to the methylation rates in young primary king (YPK), secondary king (SK), and old primary king (OPK) in the paper "Transgenerational epigenetic effect of kings’ aging on offspring’s caste fate mediated by sperm DNA methylation in termites"

The file "analysis_code_methylome.txt" contains the Linux code. The files "logistic_more10_formula.py", "manhattan_meth.py", "manhattan_pvalue_M_more10_hypermeth.py", "meth_diff_more10.py", "qqplot_pvalue_M_more10_hypermeth.py", "ratio_corr_pvalue_M_more10.py", "venn_diagram.py", and "volcano.py" contain the Python code.

The original datasets used in this repository are publicly available through both the associated research article and Figshare:
